## overview: 
- intro to sentiment analysis as a model/technology 
- basic implementation with a pre-made model in hugging face (with simple sentences, and then basic c/p reviews)
- then building a review specific sentiment analysis model (using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hj5992/restaurantreviews) dataset).

stretch: 
- turn sentiment analysis into a gradient https://cssgradient.io/
- have images of bleecker st that you overlay with the sentiment analysis gradient, collage the images together on a basic webpage.
